# 🥊 2D Fighter – CS50 Final Project

## 🎮 Project Overview
This is a 2D local multiplayer fighting game developed in **Unity** using **C#**, built over 17 days for my CS50 final project. It’s inspired by classic arcade fighters, with a simple design and solid mechanics. Along the way, I learned Unity basics with Unity Essentials, player movement systems, game logic, UI systems, and how to manage builds and debugging.

## 📹 Demo Video
Coming soon...  
Will be uploaded to my YouTube channel: [Obscura](https://youtube.com/@Obscura-One)

## 🧑‍💻 What I Learned
- Unity’s scene system, player input, and game loop
- C# programming with classes and objects
- Creating responsive UI with transitions
- Using UnityEvents and serialization
- Managing assets, animation states, and hitboxes
- Solving platform issues (like build audio bugs & Manjaro driver nukes 😅)

---

## 🧾 Code Notes
All code was written by me unless otherwise stated.  
Some movement/input logic was inspired by:
- Brackeys tutorials (Most of the concept was learned from there, no code was copied though)
- Unity Forum threads (same as above)
- Chatgpt
Any such parts are commented clearly in the scripts.
